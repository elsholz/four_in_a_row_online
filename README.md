four in a row online (2019)

## Frontend
The Frontend is based on `snap.svg` and `vue.js`. All menus will be created using `vue.js` and the component framework `vuetify`. The central gameplay item, that is the play field, will be rendered using `snap.svg`, which allows for a huge amount of customization and easy animation of svg items.

## Backend
The Backend is also made of 2 parts. Requests will be handled by a `Flask` server, whereas game logic will be processed by a `Python` program.
