## What is it?
Four in a Row Online is a Free and Open Source Realtime Multiplayer Online Game. The Goal of the game is to provide a decent dose of fun to everyone who plays it, be it with or without their friends (assuming they have some). The architecture of the game is kept simple and might become more complex in advanced stages of development. Ultimately, players should be able to determine as much of the game mechanics as possible by theirselves, hence, future extensions are quite possible and add to a unique experience. The Game is currently in an early stage of development.

## Setup
To run the server, which is located in `four_in_a_row_online/backend/server.py`, you need to add the package to the 
python path. For that, execute `pwd | $PYTHONPATH`. Then you can run the server from the terminal.
