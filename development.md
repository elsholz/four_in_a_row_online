# Development
To setup four_in_a_row_online for development of the python code you have to run `link_modules.py` if you are on a unix system, or manually create a link `four_in_a_row_online`  in your global python installation's `site-packages` directory. Thereby changes you make to the code within the repository automatically get applied globally and can be imported as if they were in a package installable with `pip`. On Microsoft Windows systems, linking will not work, you have to either write a script to write the files to the `site-packages` folder frequently, or find some other solution ðŸ˜‰.
